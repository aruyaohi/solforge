# 🔨 Solsmith

**Solsmith** is an intelligent, prompt-based UI for generating Solana smart contracts using natural language. It pairs a powerful LLM backend (`solforge-agent`) with a modern web-based Rust IDE built with Monaco, React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Prompt-to-Code Smart Contract Generation**  
  Generate Rust-based Solana smart contracts (via Anchor) directly from prompts.

- 🦀 **Solana & Anchor Support**  
  All generated contracts follow Anchor framework conventions and are ready for local build/test.

- 🖥️ **Rust Code Editor (Monaco)**  
  Embedded Monaco editor with Rust highlighting, formatting, and real-time editing.

- 📦 **Modular LLM Backend**  
  Uses a dedicated agent container (`solforge-agent`) for LLM prompt orchestration.

- ⚡ **Fast & Modern UI**  
  Built with Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🧠 Example Prompts

> “Create a staking pool where users deposit SPL tokens and earn rewards over time.”

> “Generate an SPL token mint contract with an admin authority.”

> “Build a vesting schedule for locked tokens using Anchor.”
